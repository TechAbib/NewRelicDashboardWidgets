#New Relic Dashboard Widgets#
This repository contains a collection of [Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-team-services-vs.aspx)
or [Team Foundation Server (TFS)](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/tfs-overview-vs.aspx)
dashboard widgets that can be used to pull in metrics from New Relic right into your VSTS/TFS dashboard.

## Getting started
If you want to start using the widgets available here, simply install them from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jonathan-mezach.new-relic-dashboard-widgets).

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to these widgets, clone this repository and make your changes. Then submit a pull request
and I'll have a look at it as soon as I can.

**Note:** This is just a side project I work on in my free time, so it might take some time for me to respond.

## Issues
Should you encounter issues while using these widgets please open a issue [here](https://github.com/jmezach/NewRelicDashboardWidgets/issues).

## Roadmap
I'm planning on expanding these widgets with a bit more functionality. Here is a short roadmap of some of the
things I'm thinking about adding (in no particular order):

* Application status widget
* Support different sizes, dynamically displaying more or less metrics
* Using a service endpoint so that the API key doesn't have to be stored in the widget configuration (not supported by VSTS/TFS at the moment)
* Explore the possibility of embedding New Relic Insights query results

Want to help out with any of the above? Please let me know.
